Scripts created to help [LT_Tom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlN_g6hadBw) with his workflow.

# rename_with_letter
Adds a prefix letter to all files in a given folder.

1. [Download the .exe](https://github.com/boppreh/toon_tools/blob/master/rename_with_letter.exe)
2. Drag and drop a folder onto `rename_with_letter.exe`.
3. Type the letter(s) you want to add and press enter.

For example, given the letter "a" it'll rename `my file.txt` to `amy file.txt`.

# restore_filenames
Will rename the numeric files in one folder to match the corresponding files in another folder. Assumes the alphabetical order of the files is the same in both folders. The order of the folders doesn't matter, it'll find the numeric folder by itself.

1. [Download the .exe](https://github.com/boppreh/toon_tools/blob/master/restore_filenames.exe)
2. Drag and drop two folders onto `restore_filenames.exe`.

For example, given a folder with files "1111.png" and "2222.png", and another folder with files "a1.png" and "a2.png", it'll rename "1111.png" and "2222.png" to "a1.png" and "a2.png".
