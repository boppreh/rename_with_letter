# rename_with_letter
Adds a prefix letter to all files in a given folder. Created to help [LT_Tom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlN_g6hadBw) with his workflow.

1. [Download the .exe](https://github.com/boppreh/rename_with_letter/raw/master/rename_with_letter.exe)
2. Drag and drop a folder onto `rename_with_letter.exe`.
3. Type the letter(s) you want to add and press enter.

For example, given the letter "a" it'll rename `my file.txt` to `amy file.txt`. Hope it helps!
